## What is Basicify?

A backdoor that you can operate from a Discord server is called Basicify, a closed source Python Discord Bot. The agent and the Discord server communicate using the **Discord API**.

## How does it work?

The Discord API is used to create the Basicify backdoor. A Discord Bot is an controller that is created and connects to a certain Discord server so that you may control it.
Because it is seen as standard Internet traffic, this link remains undetected.

**"Agents"** are the new clients that use the backdoor. Each Agent is given a special ID that they can use to access the backdoor.

## How to get it?

Put Simply, you cannot get it, for free that is, this is a modified version of public versions with also my own added commands for my own liking.

If you want the public version, use Disctopia.

## Is this paid?

Yes this version is, as it's fully custom, and it has been made to be FUD.
